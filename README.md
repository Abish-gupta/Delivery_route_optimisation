## 👀 The Delivery Challenge

Manual planning led to lost time, wasted fuel, and unhappy customers. Businesses struggled with inefficient routes, poor load allocation, and lack of transparency. The result? Revenue decline, high costs, and frustrated teams.

---

## 💡 How We Solved It (Story)

We built Delivery Route Optimisation—a unified tool that automates route planning, smart batch packing, and real-time tracking. Combining advanced Python algorithms and a live dashboard, our solution turns chaotic delivery runs into smooth, cost-effective journeys. See the [Visual Case Study](https://abish-gupta.github.io/Delivery_route_optimisation/visual_case_study/) for dramatic before-and-after results.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive dashboard demo for route and packing optimization (“works in demo”)
- Batch delivery sequencing powered by genetic algorithms and shortest-path routing
- Visual tracking module for delivery progress (UI only; no live GPS in public demo)
- Deliberately omitted for this project: No backend/API available, demo UI only contact author for actual implementation.
